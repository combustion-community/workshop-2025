## Registration

Registration interest forms for this event are available based on invitation only. Please contact Daniel I. Pineda (<daniel.pineda@utsa.edu>) to inquire. 

Participants traveling a distance greater than 30 miles to attend the meeting may receive travel funds to cover one hotel night and 1.5 days of meals. 
NSF Funding has been requested, but owing to general uncertainty with awards from the U.S. federal government this season, it is unclear if the funding will be awarded. 
Nonetheless, the workshop will happen with or without NSF funding. 
Additionally, participants who stay at the conference hotel at least two days and book using the [negotiated room block](https://book.passkey.com/event/50805700/owner/251/home) for the conference will be eligible to receive a discount on their registration for the U.S. National Meeting. 

**Note**: Since the workshop is planned to be funded by an NSF award, any awarded travel reimbursements will be open to people from US institutions only.
Participants do not need to be US citizens, but should be employed at a US-based university or national laboratory.

### Travel reimbursement

Details for travel reimbursement are forthcoming. Please contact Daniel I. Pineda (<daniel.pineda@utsa.edu>) with any questions.
